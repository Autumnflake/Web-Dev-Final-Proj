<h1>August Live Coding Demo</h1>

<p>If this class were to offer a live-stream option for example<br>
for example using MS Teams, would it improve the class.</p>
<p>Yes, I definitely think that a live-stream option would help<br>
   as well, it could provide online capabilities for students who are sick<br>
   or unable to attend class for some reason.</p>

<p>What Question might you have about the MS Teams stream option.</p>
<p>Nothing, I feel like Microsoft Teams is good enough to be used as an online platform for us to use.</p>
